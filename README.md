# StereoCapture (USB Cameras, PGR Cameras, Bumblebee XB3, etc.)

This software is designed for stereo-pair images or videos capture, which works on all USB, Point Grey Research (PGR) cameras, Bumblebee XB3 or other IEEE-1394b (FireWire) digital cameras as well as microscope. It has a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) with many practical functions that can capture image sequences or video streams. This software reduces the work of data acquisition, and makes the procedure more flexible and efficient.
